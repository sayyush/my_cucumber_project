2. What is the difference between dependency and plugin?
- Plugin is more simple than dependency, and it is similar to dependency, but plugins are used to add extra FUNCTIONALITY, not extra tool,not extra api.
- For example, cucumber dependency gave us a cucumber api, but SUREFIRE AND FAILSAFE plugin are going to add parallel testing
  capability. Normal Cucumber does not have parallel testing capability.
- Dependency is giving you full api, for example, selenium dependency gives you lots of classes, methods that you can do
  via application automation.

DEFINITIONS:
Dependency : Provides set of classes. For example , selenium dependency provides multiple classes such as Actions,
 JavascriptExecutor, findElements,... Selenium dependency is a bunch of ready classes and method.

Plugins : Provides a feature that is limited. it provides the extra functionality during the execution. For example,
 Surefire - plugin enables prarallel execution during the test execution.



  Failsafe plugin
- MAKES THE FAILURE SAFE DURING PARALLEL TESTING.
  IF ONE BROWSER FAILS, OTHER PARALLEL TEST CASES CONTINUE TO EXECUTE

   Surefire plugin
- RESPONSIBLE FOR PARALLEL TESTING
